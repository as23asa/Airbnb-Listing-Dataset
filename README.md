In this repository of GitHub, there are two files i.e, "EDA_of_Las_Vegas_Airbnb_Listing.ipynb" and "las_vegas_airbnb_data.csv" having Python code and Dataset respectively.
In this project, I have used the Dataset named "Airbnb Las Vegas Listing" collected from "kaggle".
I have covered all basic analysis of dataset such as data cleaning, data formatting.
